Resources for [*Simple Speech Representation Learning from Perceptual Data*](https://github.com/Sleepwalking/prometheus-spark/blob/master/writings/simple-speech-representation-perceptual-data-hua-2019.pdf).

This database contains 3200 pairs (2700 for training and 500 for testing) of phonemes whose perceived similarity is rated by workers on Amazon Mechnical Turk. Each pair is rated by 5 workers on a 1-to-5 discrete opinion scale.

There is also a smaller database (screening set) with only 61 token pairs but each rated by 25 workers.

| Rating | Category | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 | Identical | they sound the same |
| 4 | Very Similar | almost the same but distinguishable |
| 3 | Fair | similar but not the same |
| 2 | Poor | not so similar but related |
| 1 | Bad | completely different sounds |
